# Pingüino

This is the github repository for Pingüino, a indie game made for the Wowie Jam 3.0 "Failure is Progress"
If you don't know what Pingüino is, its basically a cute penguin run and jump game where instead of collecting the fish you most avoid the fish or you become to fat and die...

**In the time of me updating this the game is in very good state and is being constantly worked on!  :D**

This game is available to play at itch.io, Newgrounds, and Game Jolt:
